            <h3>We happy?</h3>
            <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw
                Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit
                to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

            <h3>I can do that</h3>
            <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
                I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
                case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this
                case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

            <h3>Are you ready for the truth?</h3>
            <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most
                popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that
                comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>

            <h3>No, motherfucker</h3>
            <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
                world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
                know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only
                five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that
                killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
